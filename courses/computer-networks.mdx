## Basic Terminology ðŸ“– 
***

#### Protocol 
It is a defined set of standards that computer must follow in order to communicate properly .

#### Computer Networking
The name give to full scope of how computers communicate with each other .

#### Physical Layer
Represents the physical devices that interconnects the computers . 

#### Data Link Layer
Responsible for defining a common way of interpreting signals so network devices can communicate .

#### Network Layer 
Allows different networks to communicate with each other through devices known as routers .

#### Internetwork
A collection of networks connected together through routers ,the most famous of these being the Internet .

#### Transport Layer 
It sorts out which client and server programs are supposed to get that data .

#### Cables 
Connect different devices to each other allowing data to be transmitted over them .Most common form of copper twisted cables are Cat5,Cat5e and Cat6 cables .

#### Crosstalk
When an electric pulse on one wire is accidently detected on another wire .

#### Fibre Cables 
Contains individual optical fibres which are tiny tubes made out of glass about the size of human hair .

#### Hub 
A physical layer device which allows for connections from many computers at once .

#### Collision Domain 
A network segment where only one device can communicate at a time .If multiple devices try to sending data at the same time , the electrical pulses sent accross the cable can interfere with each other .

#### Router
A device which knows how to send data between independent networks .It operated in layer 3 (Network Layer).

#### Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
Protocol used by routers to share data with each other which enables them to learn about most optimal paths to forward data .

## Physical Layer

#### Bit 
The smallest representation of data that a computer can understand it is either 1 or 0 .

#### Modulation 
A way of varying the  voltage of charge moving across a cable . It networking it is known as **line coding** .

#### Simplex and Duplex Communication
The concept that information can flow in both directions across the cable is known as **duplex** communication. If it can flow only in one direction then it is called **simplex**  .If information can be sent on both side at same time then it is called **full duplex** while if it can be sent on both directions but not at same time then it is called **half duplex** .
