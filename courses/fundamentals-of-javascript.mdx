## Javascript can change HTML content

One of many JavaScript HTML methods is getElementById().
The example below "finds" an HTML element (with id="demo"), and changes the element content (innerHTML) to "Hello JavaScript":

```javascript
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript";
```
JavaScript accepts both double and single quotes:

```javascript
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = 'Hello JavaScript';
```
