<Section data-name="Introduction">

## Before getting started

On linux, check all existing shells on your computer by running :
```bash
> cat /etc/shells
```

You can check path to your bash shell using command :
```bash
> which bash
```

<Section data-name="First BASH script">

## Your first BASH script

1. Naviagate to desktop and create a file my-first-script .
2. Now open file in your favourite IDE/code editor ( btw mine is VS Code ).
3. Paste the code written below:
```bash
#! /bin/bash
echo "This is my first BASH script"
```

4. Open terminal in root of project and then make the script executable by running following command from terminal :
```bash
> chmod +x my-first-script
```
5. Now execute the script from terminal using command :

```bash
./my-first-script
```

You should see following printed out on terminal .
```bash
This is my first bash script
```

<Section data-name="Comments">

* Following line shows single line comment in bash 

```bash
# this is single line comment
```

* Following line shows multi line comment in bash 
```bash
: ' 
this 
is 
multi 
line 
comment
'
```

* If you want to also show comment on terminal you can use heredoc . Following code shows heredoc
with delimiter name mydelimiter ( it can be anything ) .
```bash
cat << mydelimiter
this is sample comment text
written in heredoc
mydelimiter
```

## Writing to a file  

* Following command outputs "Hello world" to file hello.txt

```bash
echo Hello World > hello.txt
```

Note : '>' sign overwrites file contents while '>>' sign appends to file content .

* Following command takes input from terminal and outputs to file hello.txt
```bash
cat > hello.txt
```

Note: When you are done giving input press Ctrl-c on terminal .

<Section data-name="Conditional Statements">

## Conditional Statements

* If statement

```bash
count = 10 # setting count variable to 10
if [ $count -eq 10 ] # checking if count is equal 10
then
    echo "Yes count is 10"
fi # closing if statement 
```

Another syntax for same 

```bash
count = 10  
if (($count == 10 )) 
then
    echo "Yes count is 10"
fi 
```

* If Else statement 
```bash
count = 10
if [ $count -lt 5 ] # check if count is less than 5
then
    echo "Count is less than 5"
else
    echo "Count is greater than 5"
fi
```

Note : Other comparators are ne ( not equal ) , le (less than or equal) , ge(greater than or equal) etc .

* Else if 
```bash 
count=15
if (($count < 10))   
then 
    echo "Count is less than 10"
elif (($count <  20))  
then
    echo "Count is less than 20"
else 
    echo "Both if conditions are false "
fi
```

<Section data-name="Logical Operators">

## Logical Operators

* AND Operator

```bash
age = 21
if (( age > 18)) && (( $age < 30)) # logical AND
then
    echo "Your age is between 18 and 30"
fi
```

* OR Operator

```bash
age =18 
if (( $age == 18)) || (( $age == 30)) # logical OR
then
    echo "Your age is 18 or 30"
fi
```

</Section>

<Section data-name="Loops" >

## for loops

* range based for loop
```bash
for num in 1 2 3 4 5 
  do
    echo "$num"
done
```

Another Syntax
```bash
for num in {1..5} # {1..5} converts to "1 2 3 4 5" and {1..5..2} converts to "1 3 5" (with step 2 )
  do
    echo "$num"
done
```

Printing all files and directories in current directory
```bash
for f in $(ls)
  do
    echo "$f"
done
```

* Traditional for loop
```bash     
for (( i=0 ; i< 10 ; i++ ))  # print numbers starting from 0 to less than 10
  do
    echo "$i"
done
```

## while loops

While loop runs as long as the condition is true .

```bash
i=0
while (($i<10)) # while i is less than 10 run loop
  do
    echo "$i"
    i=$((i+1)) # increment i by 1 
done
```

## until loops

Until loop runs as long as the condition is not true .

```bash
i=0
until (($i>10)) # until i is not greater than 10 loop runs
  do
    echo "$i"
    i=$((i+1)) 
done
```
