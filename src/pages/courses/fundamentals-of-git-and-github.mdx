<H2> What is Git about ?</H2>

- Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

- Git relies on the basis of distributed development of a software where more than one developer may have access to the source code of a specific application and can modify changes to it which may be seen by other developers..

- Initially designed and developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development in 2005.

- Every git working directory is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking capabilities, independent of network access or a central server.

- Git allows a team of people to work together, all using the same files. And it helps the team cope up with the confusion that tends to happen when multiple people are editing the same files.

<H2> Why use version control software ?</H2>

- Version control software allows the user to have “versions” of a project, which show the changes that were made to the code over time, and allows the user to backtrack if necessary and undo those changes.

- This ability alone – of being able to compare two versions or reverse changes, makes it fairly invaluable when working on larger projects.

- In a version control system, the changes would be saved just in time – a patch file that could be applied to one version, in order to make it the same as the next version.

- All versions are stored on a central server, and individual developers checkout and upload changes back to this server.

<H2> Characteristics of Git</H2>

1.  Strong support for non-linear development

    - Git supports rapid branching and merging, and includes specific tools for visualizing and navigating a non-linear development history.

    - A major assumption in Git is that a change will be merged more often than it is written.

    - Branches in Git are very lightweight.

2.  Distributed development

    - Git provides each developer a local copy of the entire development history, and changes are copied from one such repository to another.

    - The changes can be merged in the same way as a locally developed branch very efficiently and effectively.



3.  Compatibility with existing systems/protocol



    - Git has a CVS server emulation, which enables the use of existing CVS clients and IDE plugins to access Git repositories.



4.  Efficient handling of large projects



    - Git is very fast and scalable compared to other version control systems.

    - The fetching power from a local repository is much faster than what possible with remote server.



5.  Data Assurance

    - The Git history is stored in such a way that the ID of a particular version depends upon the complete development history leading up to that commit.

    - Once published, it is not possible to change the old versions without it being noticed.
