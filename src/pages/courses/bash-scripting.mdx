<Section data-name="Introduction">



<H2> Before getting started</H2>



On linux, check all existing shells on your computer by running :



<Command>cat /etc/shells</Command>



You can check path to your bash shell using command :



<Command> which bash </Command>



</Section>



<Section data-name="First BASH script">



<H2> Your first BASH script</H2>



1. Naviagate to desktop and create a file my-first-script .

2. Now open file in your favourite IDE/code editor ( btw mine is VS Code ).

3. Paste the code written below:



```bash

#! /bin/bash

echo "This is my first BASH script"

```



4. Open terminal in root of project and then make the script executable by running following command from terminal :



<Command> chmod +x my-first-script </Command>



5. Now execute the script from terminal using command :



<Command> ./my-first-script </Command>



You should see following printed out on terminal .



<Output> This is my first bash script </Output>



</Section>



<Section data-name="Comments">



- Following line shows single line comment in bash



```bash

# this is single line comment

```



- Following line shows multi line comment in bash



```bash

: '

this

is

multi

line

comment

'

```



- If you want to also show comment on terminal you can use heredoc . Following code shows heredoc

  with delimiter name mydelimiter ( it can be anything ) .



```bash

cat << mydelimiter

this is sample comment text

written in heredoc

mydelimiter

```

<Section data-name="Useful Techniques">



<H2> Writing to a file</H2>



- Following command outputs "Hello world" to file hello.txt



<Command> echo Hello World > hello.txt </Command>



Note : '>' sign overwrites file contents while '>>' sign appends to file content .



- Following command takes input from terminal and outputs to file hello.txt



<Command> cat > hello.txt </Command>



Note: When you are done giving input press Ctrl-c on terminal .



</Section>



<Section data-name="Conditional Statements">



<H2> Conditional Statements</H2>



- If statement



```bash

count = 10 # setting count variable to 10

if [ $count -eq 10 ] # checking if count is equal 10

then

    echo "Yes count is 10"

fi # closing if statement

```



Another syntax for same



```bash

count = 10

if (($count == 10 ))

then

    echo "Yes count is 10"

fi

```



- If Else statement



```bash

count = 10

if [ $count -lt 5 ] # check if count is less than 5

then

    echo "Count is less than 5"

else

    echo "Count is greater than 5"

fi

```



Note : Other comparators are ne ( not equal ) , le (less than or equal) , ge(greater than or equal) etc .



- Else if



```bash

count=15

if (($count < 10))

then

    echo "Count is less than 10"

elif (($count <  20))

then

    echo "Count is less than 20"

else

    echo "Both if conditions are false "

fi

```



</Section>



<Section data-name="Logical Operators">



<H2> Logical Operators</H2>



- AND Operator



```bash

age = 21

if (( age > 18)) && (( $age < 30)) # logical AND

then

    echo "Your age is between 18 and 30"

fi

```



- OR Operator



```bash

age =18

if (( $age == 18)) || (( $age == 30)) # logical OR

then

    echo "Your age is 18 or 30"

fi

```



</Section>



<Section data-name="Loops" >



<H2> for loops</H2>



- range based for loop



```bash

for num in 1 2 3 4 5

  do

    echo "$num"

done

```



Another Syntax



```bash

for num in {1..5} # {1..5} converts to "1 2 3 4 5" and {1..5..2} converts to "1 3 5" (with step 2 )

  do

    echo "$num"

done

```



Printing all files and directories in current directory



```bash

for f in $(ls)

  do

    echo "$f"

done

```



- Traditional for loop



```bash

for (( i=0 ; i< 10 ; i++ ))  # print numbers starting from 0 to less than 10

  do

    echo "$i"

done

```



<H2> while loops</H2>



While loop runs as long as the condition is true .



```bash

i=0

while (($i<10)) # while i is less than 10 run loop

  do

    echo "$i"

    i=$((i+1)) # increment i by 1

done

```



<H2> until loops</H2>



Until loop runs as long as the condition is not true .



```bash

i=0

until (($i>10)) # until i is not greater than 10 loop runs

  do

    echo "$i"

    i=$((i+1))

done

```



</Section>



<Section data-name="Program Inputs">



<H2> Inputs in Bash</H2>



- Taking variables as input



```bash

echo "Enter your age"

read age  # taking age variable as input

echo "Your age is $age"

```



- Taking script arguments



Run script and pass arguments as shown :

./your-script devreads is awesome



```bash

echo $0 #prints filename i.e ./your-script

echo $1 # prints first argument i.e devreads

echo $2 # prints second argument i.e is

echo $3 # prints third argument i.e awesome

```



- Read and print contents of file file.txt using while loop



```bash

while read line

  do

    echo $line

done < file.txt

```



</Section>



<Section>



<H2> Program Output</H2>



- Print STDOUT of program



This is our bash script



```bash

echo "Hello world"

```



Run command :



<Command> ./your-script > output.txt </Command>

This will make a file output.txt as well as add script program output (STDOUT) to

output.txt{" "}



- Printing STDERR and STDOUT of program



For our bash script



```bash

echo "Hello world"

eccho "Sorry I misspelled echo to eccho" # this error is intentionally added

```



Run command :



<Command> ./your-script 1>output.txt 2>error.txt </Command>

This will write STDOUT to output.txt and STDERR to error.txt
