## What is a compiler ?

- It is a translator which converts code written in high level language into machine language without changing its meaning .
- High level languages are written by developer whereas machine language can be understood by processor.
- It is also used to show error to processor .
- firstly the source program is compiled and translated into the object program (low level language) by compiler then in the second part, object program translated into the target program through the assembler.
